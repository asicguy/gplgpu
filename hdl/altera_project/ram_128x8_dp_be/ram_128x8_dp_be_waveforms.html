<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file ram_128x8_dp_be.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altsyncram megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design ram_128x8_dp_be.v. For the purpose of this simulation, the contents of the memory at the start of the sample waveforms is assumed to be ( 000000000000000000000000FFFFFFF0, 000000000000000000000000FFFFFFF1, 000000000000000000000000FFFFFFF2, 000000000000000000000000FFFFFFF3, ...). The design ram_128x8_dp_be.v has two read/write ports. Read/write port A has 8 words of 128 bits each and Read/write port B has 8 words of 128 bits each. The output of the read/write port A is unregistered. The output of the read/write port B is </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design under normal read conditions. The read happens at the rising edge of the enabled clock cycle. The output from the RAM is undefined until after the first rising edge of the read clock. The clock enable on the read side input registers are disabled. </P>

<P><CENTER><FONT size=2>Fig. 2 : Waveform showing write operation </CENTER></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design under normal write conditions. The write cycle is assumed to be from the rising edge of the enabled clock in which wren is high till the rising edge of the next clock cycle. In BIDIR_DUAL_PORT mode, when the write happens at the same address as the one being read in the other port, the read output is unknown. During a write cycle on a port  or B), the new data flows through to the output of the same port. Actual write into the RAM happens at the falling edge of the write clock. Actual write into the RAM happens at the rising edge or falling edge of the write clock, depending on whether the RAM blocks are assigned to M-RAM or not. In the sample waveforms, they are shown to be on the falling edge of the write clock. The clock enable on the write side input registers are disabled. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design under write conditions using byteenable ports. During the write cycle on a port  or B), only the bytes that are being written to flow through and the disabled bytes show up as unknown in the output in the write cycle. </P>
