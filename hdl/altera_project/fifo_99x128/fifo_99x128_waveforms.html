<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file fifo_99x128.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design fifo_99x128.v. The design fifo_99x128.v has a depth of 128 words of 99 bits each. The output of the fifo is unregistered. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode. The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design for FIFO full condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
