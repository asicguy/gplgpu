<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file fifo_144x128.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design fifo_144x128.v. The design fifo_144x128.v has a depth of 128 words of 144 bits each. The output of the fifo is registered. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode. The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
