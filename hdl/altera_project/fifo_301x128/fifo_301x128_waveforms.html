<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file fifo_301x128.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design fifo_301x128.v. The design fifo_301x128.v has a depth of 128 words of 301 bits each. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode. The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the FIFO under wrfull condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
