<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file spll_pll.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altpll megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design spll_pll.v. The design spll_pll.v has Cyclone II FAST pll configured in NORMAL mode The primary clock input to the PLL is INCLK0, with clock period 8888 ps. CLK0 multiply by = 1, CLK0 divide by = 1, CLK0 phase_shift = 0 CLK1 multiply by = 1, CLK1 divide by = 1, CLK1 phase_shift = -2222 Output port LOCKED is used. This port will go high when the PLL locks to the input clock. Input port ARESET is used. This port is active high. When asserted, it will cause the LOCKED port and all CLK outputs to drop to zero. The PLL will relock to the input clock when this port is deasserted. Input port PLLENA is used. This port is active high. When deasserted, it will cause the PLL to unlock, and the LOCKED port and all CLK outputs will drop to zero. </P>
